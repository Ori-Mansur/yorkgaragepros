A ribbed garage door panel features a series of evenly spaced, narrow horizontal ridges or "ribs" across its surface. This design provides a clean, industrial aesthetic while significantly increasing the door's structural integrity and resistance to daily wear. Ribbed panels are a popular choice for homeowners seeking a contemporary look or business owners requiring heavy-duty reliability.

Our Ribbed Panels are engineered for high-performance environments, offering an R-Value of 16 with a 2-inch thickness and 24-gauge reinforced steel skins. The deep ribbed design helps resist deflection and maintains a pristine appearance even in high-traffic residential or commercial applications.
