Garage door lift cables are critical for transferring the balancing force of the torsion springs to the door itself. These steel cables are under constant tension, and when they fail—by snapping, slipping off the drum, or fraying—your door will immediately become unbalanced and dangerous, often leading to it coming **off its tracks**.

### The Risk of Frayed or Snapped Cables



* **Door Derailment:** A broken cable causes one side of the door to lose its lifting support, pulling the door sideways and forcing rollers out of the tracks.
* **Improper Closing:** A frayed cable will prevent the door from closing evenly, leaving gaps that compromise security and energy efficiency.
* **Cause of Failure:** Cables typically fail due to rust, friction from misaligned tracks, or exceeding their lifespan. They are designed to match the lifespan of the springs.

### Our Expert Lift Cable Repair Service

1.  **Safety First:** We stabilize the door and tension system before beginning work.
2.  **Cable Replacement:** We replace both lift cables with **new, heavy-duty galvanized cables** engineered for the exact weight and height of your door. We never replace just one cable, as this leads to future imbalance.
3.  **Drum Inspection:** We inspect the cable drums for wear and ensure the new cables are spooled correctly, preventing future slipping.
4.  **Track Inspection:** We check the tracks for any bends or debris that may have caused the initial failure, ensuring a smooth path.

If your garage door is sitting crooked or you see visible fraying on the cables, stop using the door immediately and call us for professional lift cable replacement.
