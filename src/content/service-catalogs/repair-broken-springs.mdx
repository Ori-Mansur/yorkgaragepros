A broken garage door spring is the single most common reason a door stops working, and it's also the most dangerous component to repair yourself. Springs (either torsion springs above the door or extension springs along the tracks) are responsible for balancing the massive weight of your garage door.

### Why You Need Immediate Professional Service


The springs hold immense kinetic energy. When a spring breaks, it releases that energy, often with a loud noise. **Never attempt to operate or fix a door with a broken spring.**

* **Safety Risk:** DIY attempts at spring repair are extremely hazardous and a leading cause of severe injury among homeowners.
* **Door Damage:** Operating the door opener with a broken spring will quickly destroy the opener motor, gears, and potentially bend the entire track system, leading to much more expensive repairs.

### Our Expert Spring Replacement Process

1.  **Safety Assessment:** We immediately secure the door to prevent sudden movement.
2.  **Spring Type:** We identify the required spring (Torsion or Extension) and calculate the necessary wire size and length based on the door's weight and height.
3.  **Full Replacement:** For maximum safety and balanced operation, we recommend and perform a **full replacement of both springs** (even if only one is broken) to ensure equal tension and longevity.
4.  **High-Cycle Springs:** We only install high-quality, oil-tempered, high-cycle springs (minimum 10,000 cycles) to provide peace of mind and industry-leading lifespan.

If your spring is broken, **stop using the door immediately** and contact York Garage Pros for urgent and safe replacement service.
