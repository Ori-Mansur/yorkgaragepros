[cite_start]A Carriage House Panel garage door is a distinctive design characterized by elongated, evenly spaced vertical grooves or panels running the full height of the door[cite: 60]. [cite_start]This style offers a sleek, modern appearance while adding texture and depth to the surface[cite: 53]. [cite_start]This combination makes it a popular choice across a variety of architectural styles[cite: 61].

[cite_start]Our Carriage House doors feature R-Value 18 insulation, a 2-inch door thickness, and a durable steel skin for long-lasting performance[cite: 54, 55].
