# Ultra-Quiet Belt Drive Garage Door Openers

A belt drive garage door opener is the premier choice for homeowners with living spaces adjacent to or above the garage. Instead of a noisy metal chain, these systems use a steel-reinforced rubber belt for near-silent operation.

We specialize in **LiftMaster** and **Chamberlain** belt drive systems that feature **MyQ Smart technology**, allowing you to monitor and control your door from your smartphone. Most of our premium installations also include a **Battery Backup**, ensuring you aren't locked out during a power outage.
