If your garage door is loud, shaky, or grinding when it opens and closes, the problem is usually the **rollers**. Rollers are the small wheels that guide the door panels along the track. Older doors often have steel rollers, which wear down, rust, and cause significant noise and friction.

### Why Roller Replacement is Essential

* **Noise Reduction:** Worn or rusted steel rollers are the primary source of loud garage door operation.
* **Preventing Derailment:** Rollers with broken bearings or worn-out wheels can stick in the track, causing the door to jump or come completely off the rails.
* **System Protection:** Replacing worn rollers reduces stress on the motor and the entire mechanical system, prolonging the life of your door opener.

### The Premium Nylon Roller Upgrade



We specialize in upgrading and replacing worn rollers with **premium, heavy-duty 13-ball bearing nylon rollers**.

* **Whisper Quiet:** Nylon minimizes the metal-on-metal contact, drastically reducing operating noise.
* **Durability:** The sealed 13-ball bearings offer superior performance and longevity compared to standard 7 or 10-ball steel rollers.
* **Full Inspection:** We replace all rollers (usually 10 to 12 depending on the door size) and perform track cleaning and alignment as part of the service.

If you are tired of your garage door sounding like a freight train, contact us today for a quiet, long-lasting nylon roller upgrade.
