[cite_start]A flush garage door panel is a sleek, minimalist style that features a smooth and flat surface with no raised or recessed designs[cite: 92, 102, 94, 95, 96]. [cite_start]This flat surface gives it a sleek and minimalist appearance, making it a popular choice for contemporary and minimalist architecture[cite: 97, 98, 99, 103].

[cite_start]Our Flush Panels offer an R-Value of 18 with a 2-inch door thickness and steel skin for maximum energy efficiency and durability[cite: 89, 90, 91].
