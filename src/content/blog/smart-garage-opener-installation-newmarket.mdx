It’s not every day we run into a **Stanley Imperial** that’s still kicking. These units were built like tanks and served homeowners well for decades, but by today’s standards, they’ve become the "loud neighbors" of the garage world.

We recently headed over to a home in Newmarket to swap out one of these relics for a brand-new **Chamberlain Smart Opener**. 

### The Security Gap
The old Stanley (pictured below) relies on manual DIP switches for its security. In the world of modern home protection, these are a major weak point. Because the signal is fixed, it’s much easier for tech-savvy intruders to intercept than the "rolling codes" used by modern systems.

### A Much Quieter Morning
Aside from the massive security boost, the most immediate change the homeowner noticed was the sound—or lack of it. The old chain drive had years of dust and metal-on-metal wear, creating a heavy "clunk" that echoed through the house. The new Chamberlain installation is remarkably quiet, which is a game-changer for homes with bedrooms located directly above the garage.

### Living with a Smart Garage Door Opener
The real magic happens once we connect the unit to the home Wi-Fi. By using the **myQ integration**, this homeowner now enjoys:

* **Instant Alerts:** Their phone pings them if the door is opened or left open too long.
* **Remote Access:** They can let a delivery driver or family member in from anywhere via the app.
* **Total Peace of Mind:** That "did I remember to close the garage?" anxiety on the drive to work is gone forever.

If your opener is still using a physical chain and 80s-style switches, it has likely served its time. Moving to a smart system is one of those small home upgrades that makes a noticeable difference in your daily routine.
