## The Problem: Dangerous Track Corrosion
We recently visited a home in **Markham** where the homeowner noticed the garage door was shaking during operation. Upon inspection, we found a severe safety hazard: the base of the tracks had completely rotted through.

### Why Garage Door Tracks Rot in Ontario
In regions like Markham and the GTA, our winters are tough on hardware. Road salt and moisture accumulate at the bottom of the garage door tracks. Over time, this causes:
1. **Oxidation:** The metal weakens and flakes away.
2. **Structural Instability:** The door can jump the tracks, leading to a "door off track" emergency.
3. **Security Risks:** A loose track makes it easier for the door to be forced open.

## The Solution: Heavy-Duty Track Replacement
For this project, we didn't just patch the rust. We performed a full **track replacement** to ensure long-term safety.

* **Removal:** We safely secured the door and removed the corroded vertical tracks.
* **Installation:** Installed a brand-new pair of heavy-duty galvanized steel tracks.
* **Calibration:** Re-aligned the sensors and checked the door balance to ensure smooth opening.

> **Safety Tip:** If you see "bubbling" paint or orange flakes at the bottom 6 inches of your track, the metal is already compromised.

## When to Call a Pro
Whether it is a **spring replacement**, a **new door installation**, or **opener repair**, catching the issue early saves you money. For this Markham family, a simple track swap prevented a much more expensive door replacement.
